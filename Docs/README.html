At first all tasks were enqueued in to the “To Do” list. Members were assigned to the tasks and as they proceeded with implementation the tasks were moved to “In Progress” list. Before the tasks were moved to “Done” table, they were enqueued to the “Pending review” table where other members could review, approve or disapprove the task.</p><p><strong>Google-Hangout:</strong> For planned meetings. </p><p>---------- <strong>How to play</strong></p><p>TicTacToe is a two player game, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. A player can choose to compete against another opponent or the computer. They player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical og diagonal row wins the game.</p><p>The board is represeanted with numbers,</p>
<pre><code>                        | 0 | 1 | 2 |
</code></pre><p> | 3 | 4 | 5 |  | 6 | 7 | 8 |</p><p>so the player's input should be an integer from 0-8. Any other inputs for player's move will not be legal and the player will be prompted to enter a valid input.</p><p>Draw is declared when the board is full and neither player has a winning row and they will be able to start a new game.</p><p>Instructions can also be found by typing <code>help</code> in the game's menu. Enjoy! </p><p>---------- <strong>Authors:</strong> </p>
