# TicTacToe #
Version 1.0 03/11/2015

Late-term assignment for Hugbúnaðarfræði, Reykjavík University.

-----
A short description of how the game was implemented
At the very beginning we held a meeting where we decided about the most essential aspects of the project such as how designed structure of classes and structure on github (how many branches, rules about pushing to the branches etc)In the process of implementation of the game SolarHringVodvaTrollin used following tools:
	-	Trello- a clever tool for planning, organizing and managing tasks. At first all tasks were enqueued in to the “To Do” list. Members were assigned to the tasks and as they proceeded with implementation the tasks were moved to “In Progress” list.  Before the tasks were moved to “Done” table, they were enqueued to the “Pending review” table where other members could review, approve or disapprove the task.
	-	Google-Hangout
