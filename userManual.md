They player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical og diagonal row wins the game. 

The board is represeanted with numbers, 

	| 1 | 2 | 3 |
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    | 7 | 8 | 9 |

so the player's input should be an integer from 0-9. Any other inputs for player's move will not be legal and the player will be prompted again to input a valid number. 

Draw is declared when the board is full and neither player has a winning row and they will be able to start a new game.
